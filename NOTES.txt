Steps : 
1. Execute db.sql. Update Application Account table record if necessary
2. Change the values in sample.html. (Only update if Application Account record is changed)
3. Update the FPX values in web.config
4. Run TMLM.EPayment.WebApi project and open sample.html and click on Submit button

Notes : 
1. FPX return url is not passed by us. I think is set somewhere in FPX portal
2. Sample.html is how should other portal call to EPayment portal
